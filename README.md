# DBMS for ABC Job Portal 📂

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Database Management System (DBMS) for the ABC Job Portal. The aim is to efficiently manage the portal's data, including user messages, threads, and other relevant data structures, using relational database management techniques.

## ✨ Main Features
- 📧 **Messaging System**: Manages user messages within the portal.
- 🧵 **Threaded Discussions**: Stores and organizes community threads.
- 📊 **Database Design**: Comprehensive relational database design, including ER diagrams and normalization.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Implement a **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** to manage the portal's data.
- Use **ERDPlus** to create the conceptual database model (ER diagrams).
- Convert the ER diagram into a **Logical Database Design** using MySQL Workbench.
- Generate sample data with **Macroo.com** and ensure proper normalization using **Excel**.

## 🛠 Tools & Platforms Used
- **ERDPlus**: For designing the conceptual and logical database models.
- **MySQL Workbench**: To create and manage database tables.
- **PHPMyAdmin**: For managing the relational schema and data dictionary.
- **Macroo.com**: To generate sample data.
- **Excel**: For normalization records and data analysis.
- **XAMPP**: Local server environment for testing and deployment.
